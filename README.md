# ExplainThis

ExplainThis is a simple web application that simplifies complex text content.  
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of a foundational front-end learning project.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

ExplainThis allows users to:

- Paste complex text into a text area
- Click a "Simplify" button
- View a simplified version of the content below

Currently, the app uses basic JavaScript logic to simulate simplification by extracting the first sentence of the input text.

This project will later evolve into an AI-powered simplification tool.
